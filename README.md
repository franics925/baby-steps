A README.md file with these sections:

☐ <Your game's title>: A description of your game. Background info of the game is a nice touch.

☐ Screenshot(s): Images of your actual game.

☐ Technologies Used: List of the technologies used, e.g., JavaScript, HTML, CSS...

☐ Getting Started: In this section include the link to your deployed game and any instructions you deem important.

☐ Frequent commits dating back to the very beginning of the project. Commit messages should be in the present tense, e.g., "Style landing page" instead of "Styled landing page".
